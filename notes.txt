You receive email
Email processor checks for attachments
Then email processor (EP) extracts the attachments
EP uploads the attachments to the recipients PLC account
find the recipients PLC uid
get the username from recipient’s email id by striping off the ‘@‘ and trailing part Note: recipients’ email id is always PLC email id, other wise one wouldn’t receive the documents sent.
find UID by username
upload attachments to that uid -
find the senders PLC uid

if in rare case the email ends with @paperlessclub.org then username is the string without the ‘@paperlessclub.org’. Use “find by username” procedure.
 if email id is not @paperlessclub.org id and “find by email” process finds Nil/Null as result then register (but not activate) the user and send him/her an email to confirm
